# CodeRabbit CLI

AI code review from the terminal. The command is `cr` (alias for `coderabbit`).

## When to Use

- Review uncommitted or committed changes before push
- Compare current branch against a base branch
- Get AI feedback on bugs, security, and code quality

## Setup

```bash
cr auth login                    # OAuth login (opens browser)
cr auth login --api-key <key>    # API key auth (non-interactive)
cr auth status                   # Check auth state
cr auth org                      # Switch organization
cr auth logout                   # Log out
```

## Review

**Reviews take 2-10+ minutes. Set tool timeout to at least 600000ms (10 min).**

```bash
# All changes (committed + uncommitted) — the default
cr review

# Uncommitted changes only (staged + unstaged)
cr review -t uncommitted

# Committed changes only
cr review -t committed

# Compare against a base branch
cr review --base main

# Compare against a specific commit
cr review --base-commit abc123

# Feed project instructions to the reviewer
cr review -c .claude/CLAUDE.md -c .coderabbit.yaml
```

## Agent Usage

When calling `cr review` from a tool or subagent:

1. **Set timeout to 600000ms or higher** — reviews are slow
2. Use `--agent` for structured JSON findings
3. Pass `--no-color` to strip ANSI escape codes
4. Default output (`--plain`) is human-readable text

```bash
cr review --agent --no-color -t uncommitted
```

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Review everything | `cr review` |
| Uncommitted only | `cr review -t uncommitted` |
| Committed only | `cr review -t committed` |
| Against main | `cr review --base main` |
| Against a commit | `cr review --base-commit <sha>` |
| With context files | `cr review -c file1 -c file2` |
| Agent output | `cr review --agent` |
| Interactive mode | `cr review --interactive` |
| Check auth | `cr auth status` |
| Login | `cr auth login` |
| Switch org | `cr auth org` |
| Update CLI | `cr update` |

## Common Mistakes

**Timeout too short.** Default 2-minute timeouts kill the review mid-flight. Always set 10+ minutes (600000ms).

**Wrong review type.** `cr review` includes both committed and uncommitted changes. Use `-t uncommitted` to review only working-tree changes.

**Missing `--no-color`.** ANSI codes clutter agent output. Always pass `--no-color` when parsing programmatically.

**No context files.** Without `-c`, the reviewer lacks project conventions. Pass your CLAUDE.md or coderabbit.yaml for better results.
