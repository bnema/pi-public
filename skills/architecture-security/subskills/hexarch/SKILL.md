# Hexagonal Architecture Audit

Scan a repository for hexagonal architecture violations. Language-agnostic. Detects wrong-direction dependencies, misplaced business logic, missing ports, and leaky abstractions. Auto-fixes mechanical violations, reports structural ones.

## Phase 1: Layer Discovery

Identify the project's hexagonal layers before scanning.

1. **Read project docs first.** Check `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and architecture docs in the repo for explicit layer definitions. These are authoritative — use them over auto-detection.

2. **Auto-detect if no docs.** Scan directory names for known patterns:

| Layer | Common directory names |
|-------|----------------------|
| Domain/core | `domain`, `core`, `model`, `models`, `entities` |
| Ports | `ports`, `interfaces`, `boundaries` |
| Adapters/infra | `adapters`, `infrastructure`, `infra`, `driven`, `driving` |
| Application | `application`, `usecase`, `usecases`, `use_cases`, `services` |
| Entry points | `cmd`, `entrypoints`, `api`, `cli`, `ui`, `web` |

3. **Build the layer map** — a mapping of each directory to its hex arch layer. This map is passed to all three agents.

4. **Detect mode.** Run `git diff` and `git diff --cached`. If changes exist: **diff mode** (scan full structure for context, filter output to changed files). If clean tree: **audit mode** (report all violations).

## Phase 2: Launch Three Agents in Parallel

Use the Agent tool to launch all three agents concurrently in a single message. Pass each agent the layer map and the full diff (if any).

### Agent 1: Dependency Direction

Scan all import/require/use statements across the codebase. Detect imports by language:
- Go: `import` blocks
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `import`/`require`
- Rust: `use`/`mod`
- Python: `import`/`from ... import`
- Other: grep for common import patterns

Flag these violations:

**Domain imports infrastructure** (Critical) — Domain/core packages importing DB drivers, HTTP libs, cloud SDKs, or framework packages. The domain layer must have zero outward dependencies.
- Auto-fix: if a port interface already exists in the ports layer whose methods match the usage, replace the infrastructure import with the port. Search ports for matching interfaces before reporting.
- Report: when no matching port exists (one needs to be created).

**Wrong-direction dependencies** (Critical) — Any inner layer importing an outer layer. The dependency rule is: adapters -> ports -> application -> domain. Never the reverse.
- Auto-fix: when an existing port can replace the direct import.
- Report: otherwise.

**Adapter-to-adapter coupling** (High) — Adapters importing other adapters instead of communicating through ports.
- Report only.

**Leaking framework types** (High) — HTTP request/response objects, ORM models, CLI framework types, or cloud SDK types appearing in domain or application layer function signatures, struct fields, or return types.
- Report only.

### Agent 2: Responsibility Placement

Read function and method bodies in each layer. Look for code that belongs elsewhere.

**Business logic in adapters** (Critical) — Validation rules, domain calculations, state machines, conditional business decisions, or transformation logic living in adapter code. Adapters should only translate between external interfaces and ports — no decisions.
- Report only (requires design decision to fix).

**Application layer doing infrastructure work** (High) — Use cases or application services making direct DB calls, HTTP requests, file system I/O, or network operations instead of going through ports.
- Report only.

**God domain package** (Medium) — A single domain/core package containing many unrelated types with no sub-boundaries. Look for packages with 10+ types spanning unrelated business concepts.
- Report only.

### Agent 3: Port Hygiene

Scan interface definitions and their usage across the codebase.

**Ports with concrete types** (High) — Port interfaces whose method signatures accept or return infrastructure types (DB models, HTTP types, ORM entities, file handles) instead of domain types.
- Report only.

**Missing ports** (Medium) — Adapters used directly by application or domain code without a port interface in between, making them non-swappable.
- Auto-fix: when a port interface exists but application code references the concrete adapter type instead — replace with the port interface.
- Report: when no port interface exists yet.

## Phase 3: Aggregate and Fix

Wait for all three agents to complete. Aggregate findings. Apply auto-fixes for mechanical violations. Skip false positives without arguing — just note and move on.

### Output Format

Group by severity, then by file:

```
## Critical
- `path/to/file:line` — Violation name: description. Why it violates hex arch. What to do instead.

## High
- `path/to/file:line` — Violation name: description.

## Medium
- `path/to/file:line` — Violation name: description.

## Auto-fixed
- `path/to/file:line` — What was changed and why.
```

**Diff mode** header: `Scanning N changed files (full project structure used for context)`

**Audit mode** header: `Full repository audit — N files scanned across M layers`

End with: `Found X critical, Y high, Z medium violations. Auto-fixed N.`
