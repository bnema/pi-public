Also use when reviewing framework defaults, content-type handling, or feature composition that could chain into vulnerabilities.

# Secure Web Application Coding

Think like a bug hunter. Secure applications without breaking functionality.

## The Audit Mindset

Vulnerabilities rarely live in obvious "security" code. They hide in parsers, normalizers, transformers, and renderers — the mundane plumbing that moves data through your app.

**Trace from attacker input:**
- Start at ingress points (forms, URLs, headers, uploads, APIs, webhooks, imports)
- Follow data through every parse → normalize → transform → render → fetch step
- Treat each step as a new trust boundary

**Review the invisible:**
- Framework defaults (parsers, content-type handling, redirect behavior)
- Parser selection and configuration
- Feature composition — benign features can chain into severe bugs, including RCE

**Prioritize by exposure:**
- Anonymous endpoints before authenticated ones
- User-controlled inputs before system-generated data

## Quick Audit Workflow

- **Map ingress:** List all entry points where untrusted data enters (forms, headers, files, APIs, imports, webhooks)
- **Trace boundary crossings:** Follow each input through parse → normalize → transform → render → fetch
- **Inspect non-obvious processors:** Check parsers, importers, PDF generators, image processors, document converters
- **Test exploit chains:** Combine harmless features (upload → preview → share, import → render → export, parse → persist → execute)
- **Verify real reachability:** Ask what an anonymous or low-privilege attacker can actually reach end-to-end with controlled data

## Common Chain Patterns

- `fetch -> parse -> callback` (SSRF, XXE, metadata access, document parser side effects)
- `upload -> convert -> preview` (SVG, image libraries, document/PDF rendering)
- `import -> normalize -> persist -> render` (stored XSS, SQLi via unsafe query building, unsafe template/output paths)

## Key Principles

- **Defense in depth:** Never rely on a single security control
- **Fail closed:** When something fails, deny access
- **Least privilege:** Grant minimum permissions necessary
- **Validate server-side:** Never trust client input
- **Encode for context:** HTML, JS, URL, CSS need different encoding

## Per-Feature Checklist

- [ ] All input validated server-side
- [ ] Parameterized queries (never string concatenation)
- [ ] Output encoded for rendering context
- [ ] Auth check on every endpoint
- [ ] Authorization verifies user owns the resource
- [ ] Errors don't leak internals (stack traces, DB schemas)
- [ ] Security headers set (see below)
- [ ] No secrets in client-side code

## Access Control

Every authenticated action needs:

1. **User-level authorization** — verify ownership at the data layer, not just routes
2. **UUIDs over sequential IDs** — prevent enumeration (unless user requests sequential)
3. **Account lifecycle** — revoke tokens/sessions immediately on removal or deactivation

**Common vulnerabilities:** IDOR, privilege escalation (horizontal and vertical), mass assignment.

**Return 404 (not 403)** for unauthorized resources to prevent enumeration.

See @access-control.md for implementation patterns and checklist.

## Client-Side Bugs

### XSS Prevention

Sanitize every user-controllable input — direct (forms, search) and indirect (URL params, headers, third-party API data, WebSocket messages).

**Often overlooked:** Error messages reflecting input, PDF generators accepting HTML, SVG uploads, markdown rendering, JSON rendered as HTML.

**Defenses:**
1. Context-specific output encoding (use framework built-ins)
2. Content Security Policy — avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for scripts
3. Input sanitization with established libraries (DOMPurify)
4. `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

### CSRF Prevention

Every state-changing endpoint needs protection, including pre-auth (login, signup, password reset, OAuth callbacks).

**Defenses:**
1. Cryptographically random CSRF tokens tied to session, validated on every state change
2. `SameSite=Strict` (or `Lax`) + `Secure` + `HttpOnly` on cookies
3. Missing token = rejected request (never optional)

**Key mistake:** Don't assume JSON content-type prevents CSRF — validate Origin/Referer AND use tokens.

### Secrets Exposure

Never expose in client code: API keys, DB strings, JWT secrets, encryption keys, OAuth secrets.

**Where secrets hide:** JS bundles, source maps, HTML comments, hidden fields, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`/`REACT_APP_*` env vars, SSR hydration data.

See @client-side-bugs.md for detailed input sources, CSP configuration, CSRF edge cases, and checklists.

## Server-Side Bugs

### SSRF

Any feature that fetches user-provided URLs — webhooks, URL previews, importers, PDF generators — opens an SSRF vector.

**Defenses:** Allowlist domains. Resolve DNS before requesting. Reject private/internal IPs. Block cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`). Limit redirects.

### File Upload

Validate type (extension + magic bytes), content, and size. Never rely on one check.

**Key attacks:** Extension bypass (`shell.php.jpg`), MIME spoofing, SVG with JS, ZIP slip, polyglot files.

**Secure handling:** Rename to UUID, store outside webroot, serve with `Content-Disposition: attachment` and `nosniff`.

### SQL Injection

Use parameterized queries. Always. ORM raw query methods are still vulnerable.

**Can't parameterize:** ORDER BY, table/column names — must whitelist. Also escape LIKE wildcards (`%`, `_`).

### XXE

Disable DTD processing and external entity resolution in XML parsers. Applies to SOAP, XML uploads, DOCX/XLSX, SVG, SAML.

### Path Traversal

Never use user input directly in file paths. Canonicalize with `realpath`, validate result starts with base directory. Prefer indirect references (map keys to paths).

See @server-side-bugs.md for bypass technique tables, per-language XXE configs, and implementation checklists.

## Open Redirect

Validate redirect URLs against an allowlist, or accept only relative paths.

**Common bypasses:** `@` symbol, subdomain abuse, protocol tricks, double encoding, unicode homographs, data URLs.

See @open-redirect.md for the full bypass table and prevention patterns.

## Password Security

- Minimum 8 chars (12+ recommended), no max (or 128)
- Allow all characters, don't require specific types
- Hash with Argon2id, bcrypt, or scrypt — never MD5/SHA1/SHA256

## Security Headers

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://api.yourdomain.com; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Cache-Control: no-store  (for sensitive pages)
```

When unsure, choose the more restrictive option and document why in a comment.
